Other information, such as credit card information provided in connection with any purchase, is maintained with appropriate privacy and security protections.</p>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information that pertains to your privacy. The Privacy Policy forms part of our agreement with you and is incorporated in this Agreement by reference.
